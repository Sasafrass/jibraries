# Jibraries

This repo is intended to provide a full list of lazy Java libraries that decided to merely replace the first letter of some random word or other known term with Java's first letter 'J' in order to construct the name for their library. For instance, [Jongo](https://jongo.org/) is a Java library to query as in Mongo shell, and just replaces Mongo's 'M' with Java's 'J'.
